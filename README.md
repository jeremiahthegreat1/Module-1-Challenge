# Code Refactor Starter Code Module 1 Project #

## Description
This project is my first graded assignment for Module 1.  This project involved using learnings from HTML, CSS, and Github/terminal to update the project for an imaginary client.  My goal with this project is to better understand how the learning from our first weeks of class can be applied in the real world.  While working on this project did help me, a majority of the improvement will come from the feedback that I receive, as I did not feel secure on this one.  I did better solidify my understanding of which commands to use when, accessibility changes for semantic HTML, and how the style sheet interacts with the HTML file.
